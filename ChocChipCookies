Ingredients:
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)
Instructions:
Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

Cream the Butter and Sugars:
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy.

Add Eggs and Vanilla:
Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.

Combine Dry Ingredients:
In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.

Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures:
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing just until combined. Do not overmix.

Add Chocolate Chips and Nuts:
Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed in the dough.

Drop Dough onto Baking Sheets:
Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Bake:
Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may appear slightly undercooked but will firm up as they cool.

Cool and Enjoy:
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Serve:
Once cooled, serve and enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies!
